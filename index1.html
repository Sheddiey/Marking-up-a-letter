      <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
      <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research 
        facility as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. 
        You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd 
        like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
        by are as follows, in order of priority:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of 
          Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<Sub>12</Sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at 
          temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C(86<sup>0</sup>F),
          when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 
          3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>*</sup>) 
        </li>
        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and 
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> 
          constructs for representing musical scores.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long 
        you'd expect the research to take, 
        required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
      </p>
      <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. 
        To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>
          A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole 
          village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
        </dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>
          Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, 
          which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around 
          in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought 
          this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <dt>Artic roobot dance</dt>
        <dd>
          An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have 
          discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by 
          inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just 
          moving like thisbecause they were really cold.
        </dd>
