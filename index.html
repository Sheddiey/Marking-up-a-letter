        <dd>
          A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
          nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough
          energy to escape it.

          If there's a
          <blockquote>black hole nearby, maybe. Scattered across</blockquote>
          the universe, black holes are objects with gravity so powerful,
          nothing can escape their grasp.

          black holes since the 18th century.

          A supernova is the colossal explosion of a star. Scientists have
          identified several types of supernova. One type, called a
          “core-collapse” supernova, occurs in the last stage in the life of
          massive stars that are at least eight times larger than our Sun.

          Even <code>though certain features</code> of the universe seem to
          require the existence of a multiverse, nothing has been directly
          observed that suggests it actually exists. So far, the evidence
          supporting the idea of a multiverse is purely theoretical, and in some
          cases, philosophical.

            <abbr title="Engineer">Eng.</abbr> Stephen Hawking’s ideas on the
            nature of black holes and the big bang might seem far removed from
            earthly life, but they stem from the kinds of questions that
            children and curious adults contemplate: Why can’t we move around in
            time the way we do in space? Why do we seem to be stuck on a
            relentless one-way conveyor belt into the future? Was there a
            beginning of the universe, and if so, what happened before?
          </dd>
          <dd>
            One of the great achievements of Hawking’s bestselling book “A Brief
            History of Time” was to connect seemingly arcane areas of
            theoretical physics to questions that tap into the curiosity of
            ordinary people. Scientists are still hashing out the nature of time
            today, but Hawking, who died early Wednesday at the age of 76, was a
            leader in the development of new ideas on the nature of time, space,
            matter, order, information and how the world came to be.
