        <dd>
          A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
          nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough
          energy to escape it.

        <dd>
          A supernova is the colossal explosion of a star. Scientists have
          identified several types of supernova. One type, called a
          “core-collapse” supernova, occurs in the last stage in the life of
          massive stars that are at least eight times larger than our Sun.

        <dd>
          Even though certain features of the universe seem to require the
          existence of a multiverse, nothing has been directly observed that
          suggests it actually exists. So far, the evidence supporting the idea
          of a multiverse is purely theoretical, and in some cases,
          philosophical.
