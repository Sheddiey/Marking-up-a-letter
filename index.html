        <dt>A black hole</dt>
        <dd>
          A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
          nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough
          energy to escape it.

            If there's a black hole nearby, maybe. Scattered across the universe, black holes are objects with gravity so powerful, nothing can escape their grasp. These objects can tear apart whole stars and planets. Scientists have theorized about the existence of black holes since the 18th century.

        <dt>A Supernova</dt>
        <dd>
          A supernova is the colossal explosion of a star. Scientists have
          identified several types of supernova. One type, called a
          “core-collapse” supernova, occurs in the last stage in the life of
          massive stars that are at least eight times larger than our Sun.

        <dt>The Multiverse</dt>
        <dd>
          Even though certain features of the universe seem to require the
          existence of a multiverse, nothing has been directly observed that
          suggests it actually exists. So far, the evidence supporting the idea
          of a multiverse is purely theoretical, and in some cases,
          philosophical.
